## Getting Started

When contributing to Shiryoku, it's good to know our best practices, tips, and tricks. Shiryoku is built using **React-TypeScript**. Uses **Material UI** components and fetches the resources from the sources file located in the `/src/data/*.json` files. You don't have to know how to work with React, or TypeScript to contribute, you can simply contribute to the project using GitHub.

If you're not sure how to contribute using GitHub, fill out this form with the resources you have and I'll help you out to add them to this project.

## How to Contribute

There's two separate guidelines for how to contribute to the Shiryoku. If you're simply looking to make some files changes to any one of the following files...

- `README.MD`
- `src/data/README.md` or `*.json`
- `CONTRIBUTING.MD`
- Or any documentation related file.

Refer to the [Basic Contributing Guidelines](#basic-contributing-guidelines). This will go over how to easily make changes without having to push any files locally.
